# Voice and Tone

## Voice

Simply put, I am an extrovet, so communication with people is very close to me, maybe even necessary. Even though it may be a professional communication with a client at the time, I always try to lighten the situation a bit with occasional humour. I always try to treat people honestly, without unnecessary exaggeration.

## Tone

My tone is very energetic, a bit forceful, but still respectful. Sometimes itâ€™s easy to distinguish whether the tone is purely positive or negative on me, I see a slight disadvantage in that.

## Style

My writing style is quite varied to the point of being slightly chaotic at times. Since I usually try to describe my thoughts in as much detail as possible to make them as comprehensible as possible to the reader, I write long sentences and then get more easily bogged down. Even though I always try to use written language in my professional life, I do not forgive myself for occasional hyperbole for lightness. That's just me.
