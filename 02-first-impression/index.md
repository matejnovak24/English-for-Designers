## First impression

I am a freelance graphic designer, open to new things and challenges. I have been doing graphic design since I was 15 years old, so I have a lot of experience. I graduated in graphic design at the secondary vocational school in Varnsdorf, and since I have a desire to constantly improve in my field, I decided to continue my studies at the University of Creative Communication in Prague.

I am at home in graphics, I create logos and complete corporate identities, creative advertising campaigns (in cooperation with my friend - idea maker) including all the necessary graphic documents (banners, billboards, etc.), marketing strategies, and other things. Always tailored and according to the client's needs.

I also work as a creative graphic designer in the online marketing agency Effectix for a number of domestic and foreign clients such as BiOOO.cz, L'Occitane, Nebbia, Synergie, Baumit, Albixon and others.

I always tell my clients, "You can't just get rid of me, I'll be with you from start to finish!"
